                <p>This report has been carefully prepared based on the timeless principles of <strong>Vedic Astrology (Jyotisha)</strong> — an ancient Indian system of understanding life through planetary alignments and cosmic influences. It is designed to offer meaningful insights into various aspects of your life, serving as a guide for self-awareness, personal growth, and conscious decision-making.</p>
                
                <p>Please note that astrology does not predict the future with absolute certainty. It highlights <em>possibilities and tendencies</em>, not fixed outcomes. The choices you make, combined with your free will and karmic path, play a defining role in shaping your destiny. The purpose of this report is to inspire reflection, clarity, and alignment with your inner potential — not to dictate outcomes or guarantee results.</p>
                
                <p>Interpretations provided herein are based on the professional understanding and experience of the astrologer, guided by classical Vedic methods and modern perspectives. As astrology is an interpretive science, different astrologers may offer varied insights based on their individual schools of thought and methodology. This report, therefore, represents one expert interpretation of your astrological configuration.</p>
                
                <p>Any recommendations, remedies, or guidance mentioned — such as gemstones, mantras, rituals, or lifestyle adjustments — are intended solely to promote harmony and well-being. These should never replace professional medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice. Always consult qualified professionals for matters related to your health, finances, or legal affairs.</p>
                
                <p>The effectiveness of any suggested remedy may vary based on individual belief, effort, and life circumstances. No specific results or outcomes are guaranteed. The insights provided are meant to assist you in making informed, mindful choices aligned with your personal journey.</p>
