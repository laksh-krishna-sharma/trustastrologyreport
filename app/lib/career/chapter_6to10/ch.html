                    <h3>6.1 Birth Imprint</h3>
                    <p>Your Lagna outlines the native blueprint you arrived with, showing the instincts you lead with before any training or conditioning steps in.</p>
                    <p>Its dispositor reveals the mood your soul chose for this lifetime. When strong, the dispositor anchors your sense of purpose; when challenged, it asks you to consciously build the qualities it lacks so you can claim the gifts it protects.</p>

                    <p>Malefics here sharpen resilience and independence; benefics make you generous, persuasive, and capable of attracting support when you are committed to your path. Together, they show how your character shapes the field of opportunities that follow.</p>

                    <p>The fourth-house connection fills in the emotional backdrop, pointing to the mentors, schools, or family situations that introduced your core work ethic and relationship with authority.</p>

                    <p>When these sub-periods align with your tenth or second houses, career accelerates. When they light up the fourth or twelfth, you are invited to rest, study, or recalibrate behind the scenes before you surge forward again.</p>
