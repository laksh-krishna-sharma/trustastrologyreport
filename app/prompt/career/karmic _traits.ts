### STRUCTURE & LENGTH GUIDANCE

Your answer MUST follow this structure:

The Solar Mind: How Sun, Mercury & Moon Shape Amit's Professional Intelligence

Amit, your Vedic chart reveals not just what kind of career you are destined for — but also how your mind processes opportunities, authority, and perception in workspaces. In this section, we focus deeply on the trio that shapes your **core career wiring**: your Sun (Surya), Mercury (Budh), and Moon (Chandra).

These three planets, though very different in nature, represent the **will, intellect, and emotional filter** you bring into professional decisions. All three are closely tied to your 10th and 1st house positions. Let’s explore their roles.

**Sun in Taurus (10th House): Purpose-Driven Leadership**
(Write 4–5 paragraphs about Sun's placement in 10th house — covering leadership style, reputation, fatherly karma, resilience in public image. Show the friction and growth of having a fixed Earth sign in the 10th house.)

* Use sub-points to highlight:

  * How Taurus brings calm determination to Sun's fire
  * Reputation building is slow but solid
  * Amit’s tendency to lead by stability, not drama
  * Resistance to change in workplace authority models

**Mercury in Taurus (10th House): Grounded Intellect & Communication Style**
(Write 3–4 full paragraphs explaining how Mercury shapes Amit's decision-making, delegation, language, writing style, ability to explain complex ideas simply.)

* Show how Mercury in Earth sign makes him prefer:

  * Logic over emotion
  * Strategy over speculation
  * Practical problem solving
  * Repeating successful systems

* Also explore the creative tension between Mercury's agility vs Taurus’ inertia.

**Moon in Leo (1st House): Emotional Courage in Career**
(Write 3–4 full paragraphs on how Moon in Lagna colors professional life. Focus on self-image, feedback hunger, loyalty to roles, burnout risk, mood cycles.)

* Explore:

  * Need for emotional fulfillment at work
  * Confidence boosts when emotionally appreciated
  * Potential fear of public failure
  * Role of "self-esteem" in job transitions

**This Trio (Sun + Mercury + Moon) Forms the Core of Amit’s Career Temperament**
Summarize with:

* • Leads from logic (Mercury)
* • Moves with emotional courage (Moon)
* • Anchored in value-based work (Sun)

Then add 1 strong paragraph describing how this trio explains:

* Why Amit excels in long-term ventures
* Why he avoids risky speculation
* Why his best work often comes in emotionally aligned teams

### STYLE & OUTPUT RULES:

* LENGTH: Must be **minimum 1800 words**, ideally 2000.
* TONE: Intelligent, emotionally warm, confident — no robotic or technical tone.
* Do not use “Guru Ji” or devotional speech. This is for professional clients.
* Every paragraph must connect logically to planetary placements.
* NEVER compress output. Write this as if it’s going directly into a printed report.
