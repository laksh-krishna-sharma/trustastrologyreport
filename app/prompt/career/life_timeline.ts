Begin with an elegant paragraph introducing the 10th House as the foundation of career, karma, and dharma. Explain its importance in shaping one’s legacy, visibility, and life mission.

**The Core Setup – Sign and Ruler of the 10th House**  
Analyze the user’s 10th House sign and its planetary ruler based on chart data.  
Discuss:
- Nature of the sign (fixed/movable/dual) and its impact on career.

- Core professional orientation: finance, creativity, leadership, education, or innovation.

**Sun and Mercury in the 10th House (if applicable)**  
Describe how key planets in the 10th House strengthen leadership, intellect, and recognition.  
If there’s a Sun–Mercury conjunction, explain how **Buddha Aditya Yoga** enhances clarity, expression, and authority.  
Show how the combination creates lasting impact in professional spaces.

**Yogas and D10 Chart Connection**  
Refer to relevant yogas (e.g., Buddha Aditya, Gaja Kesari, Raj Yogas) and their relation to the D10 (Dasamsa) chart.  
Show how D10 amplifies or modifies the main chart energies, revealing where real career karma unfolds.

**Long-Term Dharma & Evolution**
