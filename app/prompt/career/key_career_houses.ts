### STRUCTURE

**Introduction – The Flow of Time in the Career Journey**  
Open with a reflective paragraph introducing how planetary cycles create seasons of opportunity, challenge, and reinvention in a person’s professional life.

**Major Planetary Periods (Mahadasha & Antardasha)**  
Chronologically describe the user’s major planetary phases using provided data.  
For each phase:
- Explain how that planet shaped motivation, decision-making, and external results.
- Show the inner psychological and karmic growth during that time.
- Mention years or approximate age ranges to give a sense of timeline.

**Saturn, Jupiter, and Rahu Transits**  
Discuss important transits like Saturn’s movement over key houses (e.g., Ardhaastama, Sade Sati) and Jupiter’s blessings or expansions.  
Explain how these periods brought career redefinition, patience, or breakthrough.

**Upcoming Shifts and Turning Points**  
Identify the approaching planetary changes — next Mahadasha, Antardasha, or Jupiter/Saturn transits.  
Show what energies are maturing, consolidating, or closing old karmic loops.

**Psychological and Professional Themes**  
For each transition, describe both outer (career, reputation, status) and inner (confidence, clarity, wisdom) changes.  
Write with emotional resonance, not technical listing.

End with a concise summary listing key planetary periods and insights:
