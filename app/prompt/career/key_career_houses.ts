Use a conversational, emotionally resonant, intelligent tone, written in elegant paragraph-style format (not bullet points). Make sure the writing feels like it's coming from a deeply experienced, wise, and intuitive astrologer who blends technical knowledge with life insight. Do not overuse astrological jargon; wherever a term is introduced (like Rahu Mahadasha, Ashtama Shani, Jupiter Antardasha), explain what it means and how it affects the user’s career story.

In this segment, focus entirely on timing and transitions. Analyze the following:

Mahadasha and Antardasha shifts (especially Rahu and Jupiter periods)

Major transits like Ashtama Shani, Saturn Return, and Jupiter cycles

Identify age-based turning points (e.g., 2009 start of Rahu Mahadasha, Saturn in 8th from 2014–2022, Jupiter Mahadasha beginning in 2027)

Predict upcoming transitions like Jupiter–Moon or Jupiter–Rahu and what they signal for the user’s career and mindset

Talk about psychological themes of these periods (not just external events)
