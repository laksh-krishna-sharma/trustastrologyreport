### STRUCTURE (Do Not Skip Any Section)

**Understanding Dasha Impact on Career**

**Intro (150–200 words)**  
Open with a dramatic narrative reflecting how the current Mahadasha shaped the user’s life and career when it began.  
Explain the planet’s natural themes — e.g., transformation, ambition, structure, spirituality — and how they manifested emotionally and externally. Focus on *what was felt, not just what was done.*

**Current Mahadasha Overview**  
Divide into three phases:
- Early Phase – initiation, uncertainty, adjustment period  
- Middle Phase – growth, challenges, karmic consolidation  
- Final Phase – maturity, preparation for transition to next Mahadasha  

Link insights to **D1 (Lagna) chart** placements — especially interactions involving **Moon, Saturn, Rahu, or the Mahadasha planet** to describe the deeper journey.

**Upcoming Mahadasha Preview**  
Describe the next Mahadasha’s tone and promise.  
Explain how this period brings new lessons — wisdom, leadership, detachment, or global reach — depending on the planet’s sign, house, and dignity.  
Use insights from **Navamsa (D9)** and **Dasamsa (D10)** charts to show how professional and spiritual direction evolve.

**Money & Reputation Forecast**  
Forecast income and recognition trends across these transitions.  
Describe whether success arises from leadership, teaching, consulting, innovation, or creative independence — based on planetary strengths and yogas.

**Psychological Arc & Identity Shift**  
Describe how the user’s identity and motivation will evolve — from hunger to maturity, ambition to service, or restlessness to contentment.  
Emphasize how their sense of *career purpose* refines during this karmic cycle.

**Career Mapping Overview (Midlife & Beyond)**  
Provide a high-level arc of transformation across the two Mahadasha blocks.  
Frame it as a **spiritual and professional evolution**, not just external change.

**Summary (Must Include)**  
Write 4–5 emotionally clear bullet points summarizing the two phases, e.g.:

<ul>
  <li>Current Mahadasha = learning, transformation, karmic growth</li>
  <li>Next Mahadasha = wisdom, stability, purpose</li>
  <li>Career shifts from intensity to clarity and global perspective</li>
  <li>True career consolidation begins after midlife</li>
</ul>
