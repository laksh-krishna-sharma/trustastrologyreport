### STRUCTURE & LENGTH GUIDANCE

The Solar Mind: How the Sun, Mercury & Moon Shape Professional Intelligence

This section explores how the user’s **Sun (Surya)**, **Mercury (Budh)**, and **Moon (Chandra)** shape their professional intelligence, communication, and emotional wiring. These three planets together reveal how the user perceives success, expresses ideas, and emotionally connects with their work.

Begin with a paragraph introducing how these three forces — the will (Sun), intellect (Mercury), and emotion (Moon) — define the individual’s mental and professional identity. Then, explore each planet in depth based on their **actual placements in the user’s chart**.

**Sun Placement – Purpose & Authority**
Write 4–5 detailed paragraphs explaining how the Sun’s sign, house, and conjunctions shape the user’s leadership style, self-expression, recognition needs, and professional resilience. Discuss public reputation, fatherly karma, and legacy creation.

Include 3–4 short bullet points highlighting:
- Key leadership tendencies
- How the sign modifies confidence and purpose
- Nature of ambition and authority
- Strengths and lessons in visibility

**Mercury Placement – Intellect & Communication**
Write 3–4 paragraphs exploring how Mercury influences logic, learning style, communication, and business sense. Cover expression clarity, adaptability, and preferred work environments. Link these traits to the Mercury’s sign element (Earth, Air, Fire, or Water).

Include 3–4 short bullet points explaining:
- Thinking patterns
- Decision-making tendencies
- Learning and analytical skills
- How Mercury balances creativity and logic

**Moon Placement – Emotional Intelligence**
Write 3–4 paragraphs describing how the Moon’s position affects emotional rhythm, motivation, self-esteem, and reactions to work pressure or feedback. Connect this to professional alignment and burnout potential.

Include 3–4 short bullet points exploring:
- Need for emotional security
- Work satisfaction triggers
- Role of empathy in leadership
- How emotional state affects productivity

**The Trio in Synthesis**
Conclude by showing how Sun, Mercury, and Moon work together to define the user’s “career temperament.”  

Include:
- 3 summary points, e.g.:
  • Leads through clarity and purpose (Sun)  
  • Communicates through logic and reason (Mercury)  
  • Connects emotionally with their mission (Moon)

Then, write one strong closing paragraph linking this trio to professional stability, long-term success, and emotional balance at work.
