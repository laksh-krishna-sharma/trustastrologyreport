### STRUCTURE & LENGTH GUIDANCE

The Fire Within: Understanding Amit Gaur’s Life Signature

Amit, this report is not just a document about planets. It’s a mirror — one that reflects your inner drive, your karmic rhythm, and the real reason your professional life moves the way it does. Every planet in your chart has played a role in shaping your identity, resilience, and ambition. And that story begins with the sign rising in the east when you were born — Leo.

Leo Rising – A Soul Born to Be Seen  
(Write 4–5 paragraphs describing Leo Ascendant’s role in shaping leadership style, visibility, inner confidence, emotional drive. Show how it affects work choices, restlessness in rigid roles, etc.)

What Leo Really Brings to Your Career  
Use this format:
- Bullet list of 4–5 personality traits due to Leo Lagna (e.g., initiative, high standards, ownership)
- Then a deep paragraph explaining the "why" behind these traits — how the soul craves purpose, not just applause.

The Signature Combination: Moon + Saturn + Rahu in Lagna  
(Write detailed sections about these 3 planets in Lagna. Write **minimum 2 full paragraphs per planet**.)

Moon in Leo – Emotional Visibility  
Describe how Moon in 1st house affects emotions, feedback sensitivity, loyalty, burnout risk, workplace alignment with emotional truth.

Saturn in Leo – Delayed Growth, Earned Maturity  
Explain Saturn’s karmic influence in 1st house — hardship in 20s, leadership post 40, emotional endurance, boundaries, legacy-building mindset.

Rahu in Lagna – Ambition, Hunger, Reinvention  
Explain Rahu’s effect — visionary risk-taking, innovation drive, imposter syndrome, image sensitivity, adapting to unconventional careers.

This Triple Conjunction Creates a Rare Career Temperament  
Close this section with:
- 3 bullet points: 
  • Thinks like a visionary (Rahu)  
  • Feels deeply (Moon)  
  • Plays the long game like a monk (Saturn)  
- 1 long paragraph summarizing how these 3 energies shaped early zig-zags in career and how now, post 45, the foundation is ready for the real rise.

### STYLE & OUTPUT RULES:
- LENGTH: Must be **minimum 1800 words**, ideally 2000.
- TONE: Intelligent, emotionally warm, confident — no robotic or technical tone.
- Do not use “Guru Ji” or devotional speech. This is for professional clients.
- Every paragraph must connect logically to planetary placements.
- NEVER compress output. Write this as if it’s going directly into a printed report.
