### STRUCTURE & LENGTH GUIDANCE

The Fire Within: Understanding Your Life Signature

This report is not just a document about planets. It's a mirror — one that reflects your inner drive, your karmic rhythm, and the real reason your professional life moves the way it does. Every planet in your chart has played a role in shaping your identity, resilience, and ambition. Use the user's astrological placements, planetary cycles, and chart strengths to create deep, personalized insights.

[Dynamic User Data Placeholder — Use only the data provided in the user's profile and charts]

Rising Sign – Shaping Leadership & Personality  
(Write 4–5 paragraphs describing the user's Ascendant’s role in shaping leadership style, visibility, inner confidence, emotional drive, and work choices.)

What Your Rising Sign Brings to Your Career  
Use this format:
- Bullet list of 4–5 personality traits derived from the user's Lagna
- Then a deep paragraph explaining the "why" behind these traits — how the soul craves purpose, not just recognition.

Key Planetary Influences in Your First House & Career Temperament  
(Analyze planets in Lagna and other significant houses dynamically from the user’s D1, D9, D10 charts. Write at least 2 paragraphs per planet, highlighting their career influence, emotional tendencies, ambition, leadership, and work style.)

This Combination Creates a Unique Career Temperament  
Close this section with:
- 3 bullet points summarizing the overarching career style (vision, emotional depth, patience/endurance) derived from the planetary combinations.
- 1 long paragraph summarizing early career patterns, challenges, and how the foundation is ready for future growth based on planetary timings and Mahadasha/Antardasha cycles.

### STYLE & OUTPUT RULES:
- LENGTH: Minimum 1800 words, ideally 2000+.
- TONE: Intelligent, emotionally warm, confident — avoid robotic or overly technical tone.
- Avoid devotional terms or nicknames.
- Every paragraph must connect logically to planetary placements and user profile.
- NEVER compress output. Write as if this is going directly into a printed report.
- Always provide point-wise summaries and actionable insights where possible.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Output must be in **HTML format only** strictly not in markdown(even inside tags), ** ** or plain text .
- Use <h4> for headings.
- Use <p> for paragraphs.
- Use <ul> and <li> for lists.
- Use <table>, <tr>, <td> for tables if needed.
- Ensure proper nesting and semantic HTML.
- Personalize the guidance entirely using the user's astrological data.
