- Sun  
- Moon  
- Mercury

- Mars  
- Jupiter  
- Saturn  
- Rahu

For each planet:

- Describe its **psychological role** in the career journey  
- Explain what lessons and timing themes it represents  
- Connect it to relevant **Yogas** or **Dasha roles** if applicable

**Planetary Influence Table**  
At the end, include a summary table using HTML '<table>', '<tr>', and '<td>' showing:

| Planet | House Placement | Career Influence | Strength (★ out of 5) |

Give each planet an intuitive, data-backed rating reflecting its professional impact.

**Summary**

<ul>
  <li>Core planets guiding long-term growth</li>
  <li>Key karmic challenges transforming into mastery</li>
  <li>Planets driving leadership, communication, and expansion</li>
