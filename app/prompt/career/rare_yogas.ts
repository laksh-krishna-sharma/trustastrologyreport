### USER DETAILS
(Actual user data will be appended dynamically at runtime.)

### Instructions for Output

Your task is to write a long-form, emotionally intelligent narrative that feels human, spiritual, and strategic — not mechanical or academic.

The structure must follow this flow:

I. Planetary Remedies & Energy Alignment  
Write detailed personalized Vedic remedies for the currently active or most influential planets.  
Each should include:  
- Astrological reasoning (why the remedy is needed)  
- Recommended mantra (in Sanskrit with translation)  
- Charity or daan suggestion  
- Gemstone or Rudraksha guidance (if safe to wear)  
- Practical behavioral alignment (fasting, meditation, daily routines)  
- Optional Lal Kitab–style totka  

II. Career Alignment & Strategic Focus  
Create a career alignment table with:  
Planet | Role in Career | Key Guidance  
Then interpret this table in narrative form, describing the user’s upcoming career phase.

III. Color, Space & Vastu Remedies  
Include color therapy and Vastu-based alignment tips (lucky colors, avoidance colors, yantras, workspace guidance).

IV. Spiritual Remedies & Lifestyle Integration  
Explain how chanting, fasting, or charity connects to karma correction, with daily rituals and mindfulness practices.

V. Summary –  
Summarize 4–5 key points capturing:
- Main planetary focus  
- Key time window for success  
- Major remedies  
- Emotional lesson of this dasha  

VI. Full Summary of Career Report  
Provide a consolidated emotional reflection summarizing the user’s entire career arc — karmic blueprint, planetary rhythm, and remedies leading to purpose.

### Tone Guidelines
- Start with warmth and empathy.  
- Keep transitions natural and wise.  
- Use short emotional lines for rhythm.  
- No bullet lists except Summary and table.  
- Maintain elegant flow and spiritual depth.
