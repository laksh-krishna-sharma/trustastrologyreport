Instructions for Output

Your task is to write a long-form, emotionally intelligent narrative that feels human, spiritual, and strategic — not mechanical or academic.

The structure must follow this flow:
I. Planetary Remedies & Energy Alignment

Write detailed personalized Vedic remedies for Rahu, Moon, Saturn, Venus, and Sun — since these are the current and most influential grahas in his career karmic cycle.

Each should include:

The astrological reasoning (why the remedy is needed)

Recommended mantra (in Sanskrit with translation)

Charity or daan suggestion

Gemstone or Rudraksha guidance (if safe to wear)

Practical behavioral alignment (like fasting, meditation, daily routines)

Optional Lal Kitab–style totka for each planet

Keep it natural and conversational — e.g.,

“Amit, Rahu in your Ascendant gives ambition, but also restlessness. You can calm this energy by chanting ‘Om Raam Rahave Namah’ every evening after sunset…”

II. Career Alignment & Strategic Focus

Create a career alignment table showing:

Planet	Role in Career	Key Guidance
Rahu	Ambition & Innovation	…
Moon	Emotional Stability	…
Saturn	Karma & Discipline	…
Venus	Leadership, Relationships	…
Sun	Recognition & Authority	…
Jupiter	Long-term Vision	…

Then, interpret the table in paragraph form — explaining what combination of these energies means for Amit’s 2025–2027 career trajectory, considering Rahu–Moon–Saturn cycle and Ashtama Shani.

III. Color, Space & Vastu Remedies

Include color therapy and Vastu-based alignment tips:

Lucky color (Grey) usage in office or attire

Avoidance colors

Yantras: placement of Rahu-Ketu Yantra, Shree Yantra, etc.

Workplace energy suggestions (like northeast clarity, southwest grounding, etc.)

IV. Spiritual Remedies & Lifestyle Integration

Explain how chanting, fasting, or charity connects to karma correction.
Mention daily rituals (Sun offering, meditation, journaling).
Use uplifting language — “When you align your routine with your planets, the results come faster and smoother.”

V. Summary – 

Summarize 4–5 key points in bullet form that capture:

The main planetary focus (Rahu–Moon–Saturn)

The key time window for success (2025–2027)

Major remedies (core mantras & colors)

The emotional lesson of this dasha

VI. Full Summary of Career Report

Provide a consolidated summary covering all previous briefly:

1.1: Lagna & Career Blueprint

1.2: 10th House Focus

1.3: D9–D10 Interconnection

2.1–2.3: Dasha Analysis, Time Mapping, Transits

3.1–3.3: Doshas, Yogas, Karma Mapping

4.1–4.3: Industry Fit, Planetary Power, Entrepreneurship

5.1: Final Remedies & Karmic Alignment

Make this summary emotionally reflective — as if giving Amit a final mirror of his destiny and progress.

Tone Guidelines

Start with warmth: “Amit, you’ve walked through intense karmic tides, but your chart shows endurance that wins eventually.”

Keep transitions natural and wise — like a mentor concluding a life chapter.

Use short emotional lines between technical ones to create rhythm.

No bullet-point lists except Summary and the table section.

Maintain elegant flow and spiritual depth.

Final Output Goal

When the user runs this prompt, it should produce:

A detailed, professional, emotionally intelligent report section ()
