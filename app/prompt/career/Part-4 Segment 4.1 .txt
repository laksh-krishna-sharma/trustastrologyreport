### **Writing Guidelines**

2. Begin with a poetic sub‑headline that sets the emotional tone (e.g., *Decoding the Celestial Timeline of Growth*).
3. Describe Rahu Mahadasha (2009–2027) as the *Era of Reinvention*, showing psychological and career shifts in narrative detail.
4. Break down each Antardasha (Saturn, Mercury, Ketu, Venus, Sun, Moon, Mars, Jupiter) in chronological flow, explaining what each period felt like and how it shaped Amit’s professional evolution.
5. Give special attention to **Rahu–Mars** (current) and **Rahu–Jupiter** (upcoming) — interpret them as karmic culmination and transition phases.
6. Transition into **Jupiter Mahadasha (2027–2043)** — explain how Jupiter in the 12th House changes focus from achievement to mentorship, wisdom, and legacy.

   * Saturn in Pisces (2025–2027)

9. Conclude with a **summary summary** highlighting:

   * What Rahu taught him,
   * What Jupiter will awaken,
   * How Saturn will seal these lessons into destiny.

* Maintain grammatical precision and readability for presentation use.
* Overall length: detailed and immersive (similar depth to Segment 3.3).

Output only the final written **Segment 4.1 report**, with headings, storytelling, and the summary at the end.
